# Finite_State_Traffic_Light
This project showcases a traffic light controller implemented in Verilog. It utilizes a finite state machine (FSM) to control the sequencing and timing of the traffic lights. The code includes the Verilog module for the controller, along with a testbench for functional verification. This project serves as a practical example of digital design using Verilog and demonstrates the implementation of an FSM-based system.
